### User Stories

## Entity Relationship Diagram

### PM Tools

- Trello will act as the team project management hub to maintain organization of daily tasks, measure progress toward MVP, and document individual work loads

- [Project Board via Trello](https://trello.com/b/KoWpVwCK/final-project-kanban)

- GitHub will server as a central repository for all working code and completed steps

### Conflict Plan

- In the moment, use our agreed upon phrase ‘We need to talk’ in order to halt work and shift focus to conflict resolution.
  - If issues aren’t caught in the moment but are still simmering, use the phrase when you realize there is an issue that needs to be addressed.
- If an issue arises that is primarily an interpersonal issue (i.e. frustration with a teammate) involved parties will take a min. 15min cooldown period, then reconvene for a discussion.
  - Full team can always be involved if impartial parties are needed to diffuse tension.
  - Involve TAs / instructor as a last resort as needed
- If an issue arises regarding how to proceed with a feature wherein team members cannot agree on a best course of action, a simple majority (2:1) will win. In the case of a deadlock (should someone abstain) we will employ a digital dice roller over screen share to break the tie - high roll wins.

### Communication Plan

- Group meetings in Remo at start and end of day to check in and set tasks / confirm where everyone is on delegated tasks and reset for the next day.
  - Start of Day: 9:00 am
  - End of Day: 4:30pm
- After Hours communication will be through Slack on our group thread
- Also use Slack for any persistent communications (NOT Remo Chat)
- Group ethos is "design by consensus"
  - Use the ‘Talking Hat’ to designate the speaker at any given time and to give each member a turn at contributing.
  - Include a space for ‘Last Thoughts?’ when closing out any given discussion topic so that there is space for quieter voices to speak up before it feels too late to contribute.
- Psychological Safety Net:
  - Code Phrase: “We need to talk” = I am not feeling psychologically safe and we need to address what’s going on.
  - If issues arise during pair programming / outside of full group settings, a Group Meeting can be requested via Slack and all members will make it a priority to schedule that meeting as soon as reasonably possible.

### Work Place

- Trello: We will use a Trello Board as our primary project management tool
  - This is how we will track who is assigned to specific tasks and what tasks are yet to be done / in progress / complete
  - See "PM Tools" section above for project board link
- AM meetings we will divide up tasks for the day in a way that feels equitable to all members and set goals to be completed for end of day
  - If any work was done after hours, this would be the time to update the group and do any necessary merges before beginning the days work
- PM meetings we will review what progress has been made on those tasks that each person had tackled and discuss what (if any) tasks individual members would like to work on after hours
  - If specific tasks have been completed, we can review the code and then collectively participate in a branch merge
  - Tasks that have not been completed will be reviewed - if they are more involved than we had realized we may divide them into smaller steps or plan for paired programming time to tackle it the next day
  - No after hours work will be required, but if anyone wants to work more on a specific task they will need to declare so at the end of the day OR inform the group via Slack so that we don’t duplicate efforts

### Git Process

- ACP to individual branches often - any time significant process is made
- We will have protections in place on both the master and ‘dev’ branch so that no one can accidentally push directly to master
- Only push individual branches to the ‘dev’ branch when branches are fully functional new pieces of code. These branches may still be updated in the future
  - PR to master will occur only after a group meeting to review the ‘dev’ branch / PR and agree that it is ready to add to the master (most likely during PM meetings)
  - These group meetings can be requested by any member as they feel they reach a stopping point with their branch and will be scheduled for the next available time convenient to all members.
